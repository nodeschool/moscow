## The Quick Version

NodeSchool Moscow is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for 
everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.Conference 
participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event at the
discretion of the organizers.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in
public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography
or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical
contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action 
they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any
other concerns, please conctact an organizer or mentor. We will tell you who are 
responsible at the beginning of the event. You can also contact Finn directly (info above).

We are happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement,
provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe. 
We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at the event and related social events.
